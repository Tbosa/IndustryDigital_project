# IndustryDigital_project
This project integrates the methology, python code and results of my work done in a french industrial compagny, to answer a digitalisation problem from a Machine Learning modelling approach. This repo does not include the raw datasets used for processing and modeling stages.

- Curing model folder : <br/>
--> Python scripts for EDA, processing and modelling approach. Scikit-learn API has been used for this last step <br/>
--> Random forest and correlation matrix viz for EDA and feature importance analysis <br/>
--> R script for Multivariate Multiple Regression analysis <br/>
